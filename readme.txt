== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can’t see the banner when viewing my post. What’s wrong? =

Smart App Banners are only available on iPhones and iPads running iOS 6 and above. If you are still having issues with seeing the Smart App Banner then it can be helpful to “View Source” of the actual post/page and search for “apple-itunes-app”. If you can find “apple-itunes-app” in your page source code then there is a tag there and you might have entered in your App ID incorrectly. If you can’t find “apple-itunes-app” in your page source then something else might be wrong.

= The banner stopped displaying on my phone =

Your phone remembers if you have already dismissed the banner. Just clear Safari’s cookies on your phone and you should be good to go.

= Where do I find the App ID for the app that I want to display? =

Use the [iTunes Link Maker](http://itunes.apple.com/linkmaker/), type the name of your app in the Search field, and select the appropriate country and media type. In the results, find your app and select iPhone App Link in the column on the right. Your app ID is the nine-digit number in between *id* and *?mt*.

= Where do I find my PHG Affiliate Code? =

Becoming a PHG affiliate is optional but it is a great way to track and monetize iTunes purchases. Once you have become a PHG affiliate just login to the [affiliate portal](https://itunes.phgconsole.performancehorizon.com/login/itunes) and copy your Affiliate Token from the upper right-hand corner of the portal. 

= What is the PHG Affiliate Campaign? =

This is the optional campaign text that you can add to your iOS Smart App Banner which lets you track your affiliate sales from a specific marketing campaign. You can see these purchases in the [affiliate portal](https://itunes.phgconsole.performancehorizon.com/login/itunes) 

= What is this App Argument about? =

The App Argument lets you pass codes for deep linking to your app. This would allow you to open a different section of your app instead of just launching it. An example would be if you wanted to open a special view in the app for users coming from your WordPress blog.
